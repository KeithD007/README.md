# On-Call Paging App for Android
## Project Description
The On-Call Paging App is an Android-based application designed for hospital environments to improve communication during urgent and emergency situations. The application allows healthcare staff to quickly page on-call personnel without relying on manual phone calls or searching through call schedules.

The app provides a centralized interface where users can select a specific role, such as CT technologist, Cath lab team, radiologist, or supervisor, and send an alert directly to the appropriate on-call individual. The goal of the project is to create a simple, efficient, and user-friendly communication tool that improves response time and workflow efficiency in healthcare settings.

## Problem Addressing
In many hospital departments, contacting on-call staff is a manual and time-consuming process. Staff must locate schedules, make phone calls, and often repeat the process if the first contact does not respond. This leads to delays in communication, workflow inefficiencies, and potential impacts on patient care.

The application addresses this problem by organizing on-call roles into a single interface and allowing users to quickly send alerts. By reducing the time needed to contact staff, the app improves response times and supports more efficient clinical workflows.
